Learn Phaser: Cameras and Effects
Review: Credits

Throughout this lesson you learned many ways to polish the effects in Phaser games, we’ve added:

    Cameras
    Special Camera Effects (Fade Out and Shake)
    Particle Emitters
    Tinted Sprites
    Parallax Scrolling

What an incredible series of good looking features our game has now!

Now that our game is looking fabulous, let’s make a little credits scene together with Codey sledding!
Instructions

We’ve added in a Credits scene after the fourth level, featuring Codey sledding away to safety. Use your skills with effects to add in a background, and make sure to put your name in there, congratulations on an amazing game!
