Learn Phaser: Multi-Scened Games
Review

Great job refactoring our game! We now have the ability add additional features using multiple Scenes!

In this lesson we covered:

    The usage of JavaScript class syntax to include multiple Scenes in a game.
    How to add multiple Scenes to config.scene.
    The ordering of the Scenes in the config.scene determines the first Scene to play .
    How to stop a Scene and start another Scene.
    How to organize our code into different files and incorporate these files into our game using <script> elements.

Instructions

If you want to challenge yourself:

    Create an EndScene class to the game.
    Add more levels to the existing game.
