Learn Phaser Basics: Color a Pegasus
Introduction

In this lesson we’re going to provide functionality to make our first game, a coloring-book game called Color a Pegasus.
Instructions

Play around with the game and take note of different interactions we’re making with objects in the game! We’re going to go through building each of those interactions in this lesson.

In this lesson we’re going to build:

    Click events for the pegasus body to color in each section with a new color.
    Click events for the palette to update the current color choice.
    Hover events for the pegasus body to indicate the part of the pegasus to be clicked.
    Hover events for the palette to show when a color is being selected (and to indicate which color is selected).
